This is a linear regression model that uses MSE to predict fare prices in NYC using the chicago taxi train dataset: https://download.mlcc.google.com/mledu-datasets/chicago_taxi_train.csv. 

To run, clone the project, download the dependecies, and run python index.py. Two graphs will appear, one using one feature, and the other using two for a closer approximation. They will appear as a new tab in your browser.
